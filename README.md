# CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science

## Intro [May 3, 2017]:
    <p>I started this CS50 course in the beginning of 2016 with Launch Code in St. Louis, MO. Then I moved to Arizona, but was unable to continue on this because I was learning web development using JavaScript. Now in May 2017, I'm restarting my project to complete the CS50 course on edX, hoping to complete the verified certificate before the end of December 2017.</p>

## Some things I will learn/improve my knowledge in include:
- Use cloud 9 IDE
- Use C, Python and JavaScript language
- Understand server-side HTTP request/response
- Command Line
- Using Visual Code Text Editor (because it provides an integrated commandline)
- Computer Science Topics: Data Structures, Variables/Scope, Algorithms (Searching and Sorting)
- Problem Solving Skills - How to think like a programmer
